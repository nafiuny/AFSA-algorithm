SwarmFish -- The Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA)

The Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA) is a population-based optimization method inspired by the social behaviors of fish in nature, such as foraging, clustering, and random swimming. It simulates how fish search for food and maintain group dynamics to explore the search space efficiently. AFSA is well-suited for solving complex optimization problems due to its simplicity, robustness, and ability to avoid local minima through diverse exploration. The algorithm has been applied in fields like engineering, image processing, and machine learning.

## Run
You can adjust the parameters based on your specific problem. This code provides a visual representation of the fish positions during execution for better insight into the process. If desired, you can disable the visualization feature to suit your preferences.
To run, just run the main file.
```
python main.py 
```
